# Introduction
Work From Home Helpdesk Support
TORONTO, ON

WFHHD are a team of IT Professionals providing full-spectrum IT services with an open and simple approach to troubleshooting issues for users working from home. We are located in Downtown Toronto and we can provide consultations via Phone, Instant Messaging, and Email for residents in the Greater Toronto Area. We will help anyone using desktop and laptops running Windows, MACOS, or Linux operating systems.   We want as many people to be able to access our service and thus, we can provide services that require little time or expertise for little to no cost.

Service Level Agreement (SLA):

WFHHD is open to anyone who seeks technical support for (most) PC or Apple Desktops/Laptops. We are a Phone/Voice-first service where clients may access a live IT Professional to help diagnose any issues as quickly as possible. Email and IM service can also be provided via WhatsApp and Telegram where an IT Professional can assist with investigating issues and suggest consultations. We identify problems and create a single issue for a possible solution. We consider both TIME and EXPERTISE when proposing solutions where issues are detailed and we suggest a consultation. All potential clients are informed via email when IT Professionals bill for time and produce invoices.

Mission

We are an IT consulting service with experience of over 15 years privately in Toronto. We strive to be a quick, simple and effective support service for troubleshooting issues to help those who are home working and are stuck with hardware and/or software issues. Most of our services do not require remote access to users' PCs and we will never ask anyone for personal information or online account access.

How We Work:

Figuring out the problem takes TIME.  

Helping you with a properly identified problem takes EXPERTISE.  

If it takes less than 20 mins over the phone to fix a problem, or troubleshooting requires little expertise, our services could be of little to no cost.  We are encouraging a 'Pay What You Can' approach but does not include costs of purchasing equipment or third-party services (i.e Web services or Design).

HOWEVER:  If we require both TIME and EXPERTISE to be applied to fixing a solution, beyond a 20 min phone conversation, then we could arrange a reasonable rate based on your issue(s) on a case-by-case basis.  This could include hourly, daily or flat-rate charges for assistance.

Phone Requests:

Weekdays between 9am-9pm, we provide a 20 minute session with an IT professional.  If there is a problem that we could troubleshoot, we will make a suggestion for consultation.  Further correspondance regarding a suggested consultation will be required to formally agree to the cost of time and expertise towards a solution to the problem.  

Instant Messaging:

You can add WFHHelpdeskSupport on WhatsApp to initiate a conversation with an IT Professional.  You can provide details of your problem including screenshots (or photos taken from your phone).  We can make suggestions towards a possible solution to your problem.  Should more time and expertise be required for your problem, we can formally agree to an arragement for a consultation.

We also provide support via email WFHHelpdesk@outlook.com that could put you in touch with an IT Professional.
