TORONTO, ON

WFHHD are a team of IT Professionals providing full-spectrum IT services with an open and simple approach to troubleshooting issues for users working from home. We are located in Downtown Toronto and we can provide consultations via Phone, Instant Messaging, and Email for residents in the Greater Toronto Area. We will help anyone using desktop and laptops running Windows, MACOS, or Linux operating systems.

Service Level Agreement (SLA):

WFHHD is open to anyone who seeks technical support for (most) PC or Apple Desktops/Laptops. We are a Phone/Voice-first service where clients may access a live IT Professional to help diagnose any issues as quickly as possible. Email and IM service can also be provided via WhatsApp and Telegram where an IT Professional can assist with investigating issues and suggest consultations. We identify problems and create a single issue for a possible solution. We consider both TIME and EXPERTISE when proposing solutions where issues are detailed and we suggest a consultation. We want as many people to be able to access our service and thus, we can provide services that require little time or expertise for little to no cost. All potential clients are informed via email when IT Professionals bill for time and produce invoices.

Mission

We have provided IT consulting services for over 15 years privately in Toronto. We strive to be a quick, simple and effective support service for troubleshooting issues to help those who are home working and are stuck with hardware and/or software issues. Most of our services do not require remote access to users' PCs and we will never ask anyone for personal information or online account access.
